An encryption from wheel swapping alphabet

Encryption of a text is following this step:
1) search for the first character in a main wheel [character availability list]
2) use the index of the first character [add the first shift key] and search for a character from a wheel
3) use the new selected character and search for the character in next wheel
4) use the index of the cheracter [add the second shift key] and search for next character from next wheel
5) use the new selected character and search for the character in next wheel
6) use the index of the cheracter [add the third shift key] and search for next character from next wheel
7) use the new selected character and search for the character in next wheel
8) use the index of the cheracter [add the second shift key] and search for next character from previous wheel
9) use the new selected character and search for the character in main wheel
10) use the index of the cheracter [add the first shift key] and search for next character from main wheel

Decryption of an encrypted text is following this step:
1) search for the first character in a main wheel [character availability list]
2) use the index of the first character [check for additional key for adding 69/lenght of main wheel then
   subtract with first shift key] and search for a character from a wheel
3) use the new selected character and search for the character in next wheel
4) use the index of the cheracter [check for additional key for adding 69/lenght of main wheel then
   subtract with first shift key] and search for next character from next wheel
5) use the new selected character and search for the character in next wheel
6) use the index of the cheracter [check for additional key for adding 69/lenght of main wheel then
   subtract with first shift key] and search for next character from next wheel
7) use the new selected character and search for the character in next wheel
8) use the index of the cheracter [check for additional key for adding 69/lenght of main wheel then
   subtract with first shift key] and search for next character from previous wheel
9) use the new selected character and search for the character in main wheel
10) use the index of the cheracter [check for additional key for adding 69/lenght of main wheel then
   subtract with first shift key] and search for next character from main wheel

At the end of encryption, you will get the encrypted text and a list of additional key for each individual
characters. The decryption step will ask for encrypted text and a list of additional key to decrypt the text.
The encryption and decryption process wiil be succesful if the wheels combination and shift keys are correct.

Understanding the "order_setting" function:

The function are used to call back and reset system refrence wheels, shift key and lock bit for encryption and decryption
proccesses. It also set the lenght of run limit for encryption and decryption proccesses,

The function consist of "self.order" and "self.order_lenght" as the back bone of the proccesses.

Setting the "self.order":

You can adjust the order of referencing wheels by following this structure:
[
[ Read from ],
[ Read to ],
[ Lock bit ],
[ Shift key ]
]

- Read from: Enter the list of a wheel as a reference to find the character's index
- Read to  : Enter the list of a wheel as a reference to find a new character
- Lock bit : [Don't adjust] A reference bit to create/use an additional key
- Shift key: Enter the list of shift key

Lock bit can be edited only if you want to add or delete a step and should be different from each other. It also should be
inversed in "decryptor.py".

Setting the "self.order_lenght" method:

This method only preserves a lenght of encryption or decryption proccesses. This method should be setted the same as number
of all wheels [main, 1, 2, 3 and 4]

For setting the referencing wheels, you can follow this:

|Read from | Read to|
|:.........|.......:|
|wheel 1 | Wheel 2|
